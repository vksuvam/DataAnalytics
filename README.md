<h3>Iris Classification</h3>

Iris classification is referred to as the "Hello World" of Machine Learning. Iris.csv file is iris flowers dataset that contains numeric attributes, and it is perfect to learn about supervised ML algorithms, mainly how to load and handle data. Also, since this is a small dataset, it can easily fit in memory without requiring special transformations capabilities or scaling.

<h3>Image To Pencil Sketch Using Python</h3>

The first step is to read the image (i.e. test.jpg) in RGB format and then convert it into a grayscale image. This will turn an image into a classic B&W image. The next step is to invert the B&W image, aka the negative image. Inversion can be used to enhance details. Then we can finally create the pencil sketch by mixing the grayscale image with the inverted blurry image. This can be done by dividing the grayscale image by the inverted blurry image. Since images are just arrays, we can easily do this by using the divide function from the CV2 library in Python.
